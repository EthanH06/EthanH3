My main contributions are geld in the 2023-11-06-Final-Project-Individual-Review.ipynb

Honestly, I was completely lost this entire first trimester until it came to the passion project where I gained the majority of my understanding of coding and learned how to code a majority of front end (absolutely none of backend I'm kinda dead on that).I've gained a decent understanding of html and javascript, kinda need to understand php better. I plan to gain a better understanding of backend so I can utilize both simultaneously without having to rely on backend being able to keep pace.

We used pseudo code to understand how exactly we were going to create our project and individual games, we created layouts for the style of the game.html so we could understand how people could access the game and used pseudo code
