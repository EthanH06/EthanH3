    "Overall, the MCQ was both entirely easy and entirely difficult. I felt as though I could easily solve basic problems that involve pseudo code, yet the ones that become advanced immediately stunned me. Definitions were one thing that was extremely easy for me, overall I hadn't gotten many if any wrong there. Graphs and data analysis was also a strong point of mine which helped raise my grade significantlly. Robot programs was quite easy yet for some reason I had overlooked question 6 which should've been an easy solution. Overflow I feel is still a weakpoint for me because its definition and causes are still foggy with me, I'll probably find some time to research about it later during or after the break. To conclude this, my mistakes were mostly made by not fully knowing about a topic/being foggy, straight carelessness, or just being lost while testing.\n",
